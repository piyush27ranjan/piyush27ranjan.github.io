So get ready to begin your journey with me through the beautiful tea gardens of the world-famous tourist destination of Darjeeling (also known as “the Queen of the Hills”) in the eastern state of West Bengal.

## Journey from NJP to Darjeeling:

The most exciting part of the trip was  Darjeeling Toy Train ride that one could take from the plains of Siliguri to Darjeeling. For a child, nothing can be more enticing than a ride on the old world steam engine train.

A full train ride from plains of Siliguri to Darjeeling, which takes travelers through all the stations and is approximately 8 hours ride. While this ride is the real deal and one can appreciate the magnitude of the construction, the heritage and effort its takes to keep the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway running in the present times, frankly, it takes up too much time (By taxi it takes only 1 and 1/2 hour on the same route).

## Must see:

1) **Tiger Hill:**  Well before the crack of dawn, make your way to Tiger Hill to see one of the most spectacular sun rises possible. Atop the Tiger Hill summit at 2,600 metres, find a spot and wait for the spectacle of when the horizon turns shades of crimson as the sun’s rays fall on the mighty Mount Kangchenjunga peak. A sight to behold!

2) **Ghoom Monastery:** With prayer flags fluttering around its premises, the Ghoom Monastery houses a towering 15-feet high statue of the Maitreya Buddha. Amongst the oldest monasteries in Darjeeling, Ghoom also houses old Buddhist manuscripts.

3) **Batasia Loop:** There is no better place to get a 360 degree view of Darjeeling's landscape including the hill town and the snow covered peaks of the Eastern Himalayas with the majestic Kanchenjunga on one side. And all this from the middle of a lovely flowering garden around which the toy train track is laid. 
Batasia means airy space. the As you stand on one side of the garden and see the toy train making a complete loop while hooting its whistle along the way and trying to negotiate the spiral track with a double loop, it's a fabulous experience. 
There are seating areas as well to enjoy the views. The entire area along with the gardens and an approach bridge that leads to the garden is about 50,000 square feet. It has been covered with grass and beautified with both seasonal and perennial flowers and shrubs. 

4) **Japanese Peace Pagoda:** Situated on Jalapahar Hill at a height of over 28 metres, the Peace Pagoda in Darjeeling is also known as the Nipponzan Myohoji Buddhist Temple. The premises of the Japanese Peace Pagoda are equally serene as is the interior of the temple, which showcases the four forms of Lord Buddha.

### Nathula Pass:

 Nathula Pass is a mountain pass in the Eastern Himalayas in Sikkim. The high altitude pass doubles up as the Indo-Chinese border that serves as the trade link between India and China. Nestled at an elevation of 14,140 feet, Nathula Pass ranks amongst the highest passes accessible by tourists via motorable road.

This mountainous pass is one of the oldest trading border posts connecting Tibet and India.  The silk route, ancient trade route used to pass through here. Currently, the Nathula Pass is marked by entrance gates of both countries (India and China) and military bunkers on both sides of the gates. It is one of the unmissable attractions in Sikkim.
